# Welcome
This is a proof of concept project for vue.js and bulma.

The goal is provide a simple boilerplate setup for quick sites as:
- season promotional
- special events invitation
- small stores splash screen (contact, location, youtube video)
- list viewers and generators

## Stack
The idea behind is to test [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [Bulma CSS](http://bulma.io/) framework that provide a minimalist composition to handle standard web implementations.

## Scope
Should be able to properly render in all modern browsers (desktop and mobile) as also be able to encapsulate as an electron application.
Run as mobile app is not part of the scope.
